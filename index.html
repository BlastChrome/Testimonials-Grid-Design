I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
learning from their experiences was easy.

gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
